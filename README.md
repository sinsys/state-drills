# React State Drills
This is a collection of state drills for reference. It includes things like updating state, using props with state side by side, some `Math	` and `Date` functions, among others as a Kitchen Sink.
## Available Components

 - `TheDate` - This is a running clock that updates real-time based on 1 second update intervals.
 - `Counter` - This is a very basic counting button component that updates the state by an interval set by props.
 - `HelloWorld` - Expansion of the prior component. Allows you to update state by using the text of the selected button.
 - `Bomb` - Uses a countdown timer to explode a bomb and updates state to demo toggling between two strings until a condition is met. A restart button is included.
 - `RouletteGun` - A play on Russian Roulette. Select the button to randomly select an integer. If that integer is identical to the loaded chamber, you lose.
 - `Tabs` - This is a basic tabs component to render different info based on the selected tab.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
